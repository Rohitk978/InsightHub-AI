🤖 InsightHub-AI


📌 Overview

AI Hub Models is a collection of Transformer-powered NLP applications showcasing the use of state-of-the-art models in Summarization, Text Generation, and Question Answering.

This project demonstrates how modern Hugging Face models can be integrated into real-world workflows for research, content creation, and intelligent Q&A.

📄 Summarization → Condenses text, PDFs, and URLs using DistilBART.

✍️ Text Generation → Generates human-like text with GPT-2.

❓ Question Answering (QA) → Answers queries using Meta-LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct.

🏗️ Core Functionalities
📄 Summarization

Model: DistilBART.

Inputs: Raw text, PDFs, Web URLs.

Output: Concise summaries.

Highlight: Fast, lightweight, and efficient.

✍️ Text Generation

Model: GPT-2.

Function: Generates context-aware, fluent text.

Use Cases: Storytelling, blogs, idea generation.

Highlight: Produces creative and coherent completions.

❓ Question Answering (QA)

Model: Meta-LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct.

Function: Extracts or generates answers from given context.

Applications: Research, study, business insights.

Highlight: Handles factual and contextual queries.

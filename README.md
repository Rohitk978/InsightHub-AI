InsightHub-AI
Overview

AI Hub Models is a collection of transformer-based NLP applications built to showcase the power of modern AI in handling diverse language tasks.
This project integrates summarization, text generation, and question answering into a single hub, demonstrating real-world usage of Hugging Face Transformers and cutting-edge models.

The system is designed to:

Summarize lengthy documents, PDFs, and web content.

Generate context-aware, human-like text.

Answer user queries accurately based on context.

Core Functionalities
üìÑ Summarization

Uses DistilBART, a lightweight distilled version of BART.

Capable of summarizing PDF files, raw text, and URLs.

Produces concise, high-quality summaries while being computationally efficient.

‚úçÔ∏è Text Generation

Powered by GPT-2.

Generates coherent, context-aware text given a user prompt.

Useful for creative writing, story generation, blog content, and more.

‚ùì Question Answering (QA)

Uses Meta-LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct.

Handles both fact-based and context-driven queries.

Provides accurate and context-sensitive answers for research and knowledge retrieval.
